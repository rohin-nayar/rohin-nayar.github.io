As a robotics engineer, it is crucial to keep code easy to read, maintainable, and scalable for future applications as the projects we work on scale quickly from prototyping and therefore have to integrate into the main code base.

[Refactoring Guru][Refactoring-Guru] is a resource I was recently recommended to explore and learn the details of design patterns. Having looked at the documentation for the Observer pattern and implemented at work, I was very pleased to be able to organize my code in a logical manner to tackle a common problem. Understanding and applying design patterns not only enhances the structure of your code but also contributes to the overall system design. Design patterns provide proven solutions to common design problems, promoting code reuse, flexibility, and maintainability.

In the context of robotics engineering, the Observer pattern, allows a subject to notify its observers of state changes without coupling the subject and observers tightly. This decoupling is crucial in robotics applications where different components must interact seamlessly. 

Combining strong programming skills with an understanding of design patterns and system design is pivotal. These skills not only improve the quality of your code but also contribute to the efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of the overall robotics system.
