## Weekly Market Insights

#### **London IPO Fall**
Shares of beauty retailer Douglas experienced a 9% decline following an underwhelming initial public offering (IPO) in Frankfurt. Meanwhile, London's IPO market showed a stark contrast, raising just Â£0.3 billion in the first quarter. This discrepancy is attributed to several factors affecting the UK market, including acquisitions of UK-listed companies, a scarcity of new issuers, and outflows from UK equity funds. In contrast, mainland Europe saw significant flotations, such as the dermatology group Galderma and Douglas.

#### **Mortgage Approvals Rise**
The UK's financial landscape showed signs of recovery, with mortgage approvals reaching a 17-month high. This uptick is linked to a decrease in the effective interest rate by 0.29%, indicating a strengthening market. For the first time since 2016, London's real estate market is poised to see properties selling above their asking price, with over 25% of homes already achieving this milestone.

#### **Wealth Management Advice - Index Linked Gilts**
In response to the volatile market conditions, wealth managers are advising retirees to de-risk their investment portfolios. A recommended strategy includes lowering equity exposure and considering index-linked gilts. These government-backed assets offer protection and are considered safe if held to maturity.

#### **Flutter IPO**
In corporate moves, Flutter Entertainment, aiming to broaden its investor base, has announced plans to pursue a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. This decision is geared towards attracting more retail investors.
