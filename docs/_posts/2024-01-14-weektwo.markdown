[The Confidence Map][Confidence-Map] by Peter Atwater is a practical exploration of confidence and its role in shaping personal narratives. Atwater breaks down confidence as a nuanced spectrum of invulnerability and uses a quadrant concept to examine the four environments we encounter in life.

The book provides real-life examples and dialogues to illustrate its points. Atwater encourages readers to evaluate their confidence levels and consider how they articulate their own stories. 

In essence, "The Confidence Map" serves as a direct guide for understanding and utilizing confidence in storytelling and self-discovery. Atwater's pragmatic approach makes it a valuable read for those seeking effective navigation of their personal narratives. Through this process, I've found myself consistently questioning how I would share my story, using these weekly reviews as a tool for discovering hidden interests and learning more about myself.
