As the New Year approaches, I take a moment to reflect on a transformative year marked by new challenges and beginnings.

Earlier this year I embarked on my industrial placement year as part of my Aeronautical Engineering degree at [Imperial College London][Imperial-College-London], joining [Airbus Defence & Space][Airbus] as an intern in the Advanced Concepts & Robotics Departmnet. During my time so far, I have actively contributed to diverse projects, gaining exposure to mechanical design, rapid prototyping with 3D printing, and collaborative software development within the team. Notably, my responsibilities extended to leading project meetings with the [European Space Agency][ESA].

Motivated by this exposure, I've embarked on a journey to become a proficient software developer, focusing on building user applications. In alignment with this commitment, I've undertaken the task of documenting my weekly progress through articles. These pieces serve as both a personal reflection and a resource for those navigating similar career trajectories or intrigued by the transition from aeronautics to robotics and software development.

As we approach the New Year, I anticipate continued growth and welcome the challenges inherent in transitioning into the field of software development. Join me each week as I dissect experiences, elucidate lessons learned, and highlight milestones achieved during this significant journey. Here's to new beginnings and the endless possibilities that lie ahead!
