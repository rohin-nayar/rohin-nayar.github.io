<p><strong>What is Project Radon?</strong></p>
<p>Project Radon is a personal development project where I aim to focus on building better habits for self-development. One of the main purposes of this site is to keep track and share progress. 
</p>

<p>I am currently studying MEng Aeronautical Engineering with A Year in Industry at Imperial College London.</p>

<p>During my placement year, I am working at Airbus Defence and Space in the Advanced Concepts and Robotics Department as a Robotic Engineer Intern. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into the field of robotics and had led me to build and develop my software engineering skills</p>

<p>On this page, you'll find weekly posts related to my current interests in robotics and software engineering. I aim to share my experiences, insights, and thoughts on various topics within these fields.</p>
