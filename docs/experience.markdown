<ul>
  <li>Architected and helped build a support UI for the VISPA Robotic Manipulator testing application, using MATLAB app designer and Python. This allowed the team to easily visualize unit testing data and compare test results.</li>
  <li>Used Kafka to develop a real-time event-driven application to produce and consume streams of data. Adopted replication and partition methods to decouple system dependencies, allowing for a fault-tolerant platform design; this enabled a high volume of users to use the UI to view data without perceptible lag or performance compromise.</li>
  <li>Used bash scripting and JFrog to automate user repository installation. This streamlined the onboarding process for new contributors.</li>
  <li>Rapid prototyped a robotic manipulator end effector for proof-of-concept demonstration using 3D printing. Reduced design development time by 2 months, enabling the project to move onto the testing phase.</li>

  <p>June 2022 - August 2023</p>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Built machine learning models in Python using TensorFlow and pandas packages to model and identify governing turbulent plasma dynamics, predominantly using pySINDY. The model successfully represented analytical equations with a 96% success rate and provided insightful recognitions of underlying turbulent factors.</li>
  
  <li>Explored feature engineering techniques, leveraging Pareto analysis to identify suitable classifiers, hyperparameters, and ensemble methods for optimal performance. These methods significantly improved accuracy and optimized the model for performance, reducing run time to process more simulation data.</li>
  
  <li>Presented research findings to the Plasma Propulsion Laboratory panel, including the supervisor. Contributions aided researchers in adapting and refining models further.</li>
